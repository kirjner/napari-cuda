# napari-engine

## Vision ðŸš€
Transform napari into a high-performance, distributed visualization engine for massive microscopy datasets. The goal is to create a "game engine" for scientific imaging - allowing standard napari to interact fluidly with remote, petabyte-scale datasets as if they were local.

## Architecture Overview

napari-engine decouples napari's frontend (Qt GUI) from its backend (Viewer model). The local napari GUI communicates with a `ProxyViewer` that forwards commands to a headless napari instance running on a remote server with direct data access.

## Technical Analysis

Based on deep investigation of napari's source code:

### âœ… What Will Work

1. **Headless Rendering** - napari already supports `Viewer(show=False)` and can render offscreen
2. **Screenshot Capability** - `viewer.screenshot()` uses Qt's `grabFramebuffer()` which works headless
3. **Viewer Model API** - Well-defined, event-driven architecture makes proxying feasible
4. **Dask Integration** - Already lazy-loads data, perfect for remote datasets

### Key Interception Points

After analyzing the codebase, the optimal approach is:

```python
# Server side - Headless napari with custom canvas
class StreamingCanvas(VispyCanvas):
    def screenshot(self):
        # Override to return tiles instead of full frame
        img = self.native.grabFramebuffer() 
        tiles = self.extract_tiles(img)
        return self.compress_tiles(tiles)

# Client side - Proxy that mimics ViewerModel
class ProxyViewer(ViewerModel):
    def __init__(self, server_address):
        self._remote = RemoteConnection(server_address)
        # Forward all ViewerModel events to server
        
    @property
    def camera(self):
        # Proxy camera commands to server
        return ProxyCamera(self._remote)
```

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Proof of Concept âœ…
- [x] Verify headless rendering works
- [x] Understand Viewer â†’ QtViewer â†’ VispyCanvas pipeline
- [x] Identify ViewerModel API surface

### Phase 2: Basic Remote Rendering
- [ ] Create headless napari server that renders to FBO
- [ ] Implement WebSocket/ZeroMQ protocol for commands
- [ ] Build ProxyViewer that forwards basic commands (camera, dims)
- [ ] Stream full frames (no tiling yet)

### Phase 3: Tiled Streaming
- [ ] Extract viewport tiles from rendered frames
- [ ] Implement tile compression (JPEG/WebP)
- [ ] Add tile caching on client
- [ ] Dirty region tracking

### Phase 4: ProxyViewer Integration
- [ ] Complete ProxyViewer API (all ViewerModel methods)
- [ ] Handle layer operations remotely
- [ ] Sync events bidirectionally
- [ ] Mouse/keyboard interaction forwarding

### Phase 5: Performance Optimization
- [ ] Dask prefetching based on navigation prediction
- [ ] Multiple render contexts for parallel tile generation
- [ ] Adaptive quality based on bandwidth
- [ ] Delta compression for temporal data

## Risk Assessment

### ðŸŸ¢ Low Risk
- **Headless Operation**: Already works with `show=False`
- **Dask/Zarr**: Designed for this use case
- **WebSocket Streaming**: Well-proven technology

### ðŸŸ¡ Medium Risk  
- **Qt Event Loop**: May need careful handling in headless mode
- **OpenGL Context**: Platform-specific quirks possible
- **Latency**: Network RTT could affect interactivity

### ðŸ”´ High Risk
- **GL Context Sharing**: Multi-threaded rendering complex
- **State Synchronization**: Keeping client/server in sync
- **Layer Interactivity**: Editing tools may be challenging

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install napari-engine
pip install -e .

# Start server on machine with data
python -m napari_engine.server --data /path/to/data.zarr --port 8765

# Connect client
python -m napari_engine.client --host server.example.com --port 8765
```

## Minimum Viable Prototype

```python
# server.py - Minimal headless server
import napari
import asyncio
import websockets
import json

class NapariServer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.viewer = napari.Viewer(show=False)
    
    async def handle_command(self, websocket):
        async for message in websocket:
            cmd = json.loads(message)
            
            if cmd['type'] == 'set_camera':
                self.viewer.camera.center = cmd['center']
                self.viewer.camera.zoom = cmd['zoom']
            
            # Render and send frame
            screenshot = self.viewer.screenshot(canvas_only=True)
            await websocket.send(screenshot.tobytes())

# client.py - Proxy viewer
class ProxyViewer:
    def __init__(self, server_url):
        self.ws = websocket.connect(server_url)
        
    def update_camera(self, center, zoom):
        self.ws.send(json.dumps({
            'type': 'set_camera',
            'center': center,
            'zoom': zoom
        }))
        frame = self.ws.recv()
        self.display(frame)
```

## Why This Will Actually Work

1. **napari's Architecture Supports It**: Clean separation between ViewerModel and rendering
2. **Headless Already Proven**: Tests confirm offscreen rendering works
3. **Event System Is Robust**: All state changes go through events - perfect for proxying
4. **Dask Does Heavy Lifting**: Data stays remote, only pixels stream

## Next Steps

1. Run `streaming/tests/test_headless.py` to verify headless rendering
2. Build minimal WebSocket server with single frame streaming  
3. Create ProxyViewer that forwards camera events
4. Test with real microscopy data on remote server

The key insight from the investigation: **napari is already 90% ready for this**. The architecture is clean, headless works, and the main challenge is engineering the streaming protocol - not hacking napari internals.
